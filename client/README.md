# Atomic Design

This project uses [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design) as it's design system.

> Atomic design gives us the ability to traverse from abstract to concrete. Because of this, we can create systems that promote consistency and scalability while simultaneously showing things in their final context. And by assembling rather than deconstructing, weâ€™re crafting a system right out of the gate instead of cherry picking patterns after the fact.
